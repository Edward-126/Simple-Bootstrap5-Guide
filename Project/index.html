                <div class="card-text"> I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always oppressed
                    with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had
                    heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not
                    only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still
                    confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the
                    extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the "Encyclopaedia" down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg
                    Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me. What was this nocturnal expedition,
                    and why should I go armed? Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes
                    that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a formidable man--a man who might play a deep
                    game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night
                    should bring an explanation.

                    which I shall endeavour to exhibit as well as I can in that gentleman's lively manner; and in
                    justice to him it is proper to add, that Dr. Johnson told me I might rely both on the correctness of
                    his memory, and the fidelity of his narrative. 'When Madame de Boufflers was first in England, (said
                    Beauclerk,) she was desirous to see Johnson. I accordingly went with her to his chambers in the
                    Temple, where she was entertained with his conversation for some time. When our visit was over, she
                    and I left him, and were got into Inner Temple-lane, when all at once I heard a noise like thunder.
                    This was occasioned by Johnson, who it seems, upon a little recollection, had taken it into his head
                    that he ought to have done the honours of his literary residence to a foreign lady of quality, and
                    eager to shew himself a man of gallantry, was hurrying down the stair-case in violent agitation. He
                    overtook us before we reached the Temple-gate, and brushing in between me and Madame de Boufflers,
                    seized her hand, and conducted her to her coach. His dress was a rusty brown morning suit, a pair of
                    old shoes by way of slippers, a little shrivelled wig sticking on the top of his head, and the
                    sleeves of his shirt and the knees of his breeches hanging loose. A considerable crowd of people
                    gathered round, and were not a little struck by this singular appearance.'

                    <div class="card-text">The worship of the senses has often, and with much justice, been decried, men
                        feeling a natural instinct of terror about passions and sensations that seem stronger than
                        themselves, and that they are conscious of sharing with the less highly organized forms of
                        existence. But it appeared to Dorian Gray that the true nature of the senses had never been
                        understood, and that they had remained savage and animal merely because the world had sought to
                        starve them into submission or to kill them by pain, instead of aiming at making them elements
                        of a new spirituality, of which a fine instinct for beauty was to be the dominant
                        characteristic. As he looked back upon man moving through history, he was haunted by a feeling
                        of loss. So much had been surrendered! and to such little purpose! There had been mad wilful
                        rejections, monstrous forms of self-torture and self-denial, whose origin was fear and whose
                        result was a degradation infinitely more terrible than that fancied degradation from which, in
                        their ignorance, they had sought to escape; Nature, in her wonderful irony, driving out the
                        anchorite to feed with the wild animals of the desert and giving to the hermit the beasts of the
                        field as his companions.

                        almost promised to answer her letter.

                        The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more. His
                        present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to
                        deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his
                        manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to
                        expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her--their opinion of
                        everybody--would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever
                        attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that, whether
                        married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing.

                    <div class="modal-body">"It would comfort me, my husband!" was all she said; and he began to read
                        when she had got the book ready.

                        "How can I--how could any one--tell of that strange scene, its solemnity, its gloom, its
                        sadness, its horror; and, withal, its sweetness. Even a sceptic, who can see nothing but a
                        travesty of bitter truth in anything holy or emotional, would have been melted to the heart had
                        he seen that little group of loving and devoted friends kneeling round that stricken and
                        sorrowing lady; or heard the tender passion of her husband's voice, as in tones so broken with
                        emotion that often he had to pause, he read the simple and beautiful service from the Burial of
                        the Dead. I--I cannot go on--words--and--v-voice--f-fail m-me!"

                        She was right in her instinct. Strange as it all was, bizarre as it may hereafter seem even to
                        us who felt its potent influence at the time, it comforted us much; and the silence, which
                        showed Mrs. Harker's coming relapse from her freedom of soul, did not seem so full of despair to
                        any of us as we had dreaded. 15 October, Varna.--We left Charing Cross on the morning of the
                        12th, got to Paris the same night, and took the places secured for us in the Orient Express. We
                        travelled night and day, arriving here at about five o'clock. Lord Godalming went to the
                        Consulate to see if any telegram had arrived for him, whilst the rest of us came on to this
                        hotel--"the Odessus." The journey may have had incidents; I was, however, too eager to get on,
                        to care for them. Until the Czarina Catherine comes into port there will be no interest for me
                        in anything in the wide world. Thank God! Mina is well, and looks to be getting stronger; her
                        colour is coming back. She sleeps a great deal; throughout the journey she slept nearly all the
                        time. Before sunrise and sunset, however, she is very wakeful and alert; and it has become a
                        habit for Van Helsing to hypnotise her at such times. At first, some effort was needed, and he
                        had to make many passes; but now, she seems to yield at once, as if by habit, and scarcely any
                        action is needed. He seems to have power at these particular moments to simply will, and her
                        thoughts obey him. He always asks her what she can see and hear. She answers to the first:--

                        "Nothing; all is dark." And to the second:--

                        "I can hear the waves lapping against the ship, and the water rushing by. Canvas and cordage
                        strain and masts and yards creak. The wind is high--I can hear it in the shrouds, and the bow
                        throws back the foam." It is evident that the Czarina Catherine is still at sea, hastening on
                        her way to Varna. Lord Godalming has just returned. He had four telegrams, one each day since we
                        started, and all to the same effect: that the Czarina Catherine had not been reported to Lloyd's
                        from anywhere. He had arranged before leaving London that his agent should send him every day a
                        telegram saying if the ship had been reported. He was to have a message even if she were not
                        reported, so that he might be sure that there was a watch being kept at the other end of the
                        wire.</div>

                    <div class="modal-body">There was no mirror, at that date, in my room; that which stands beside me
                        as I write, was brought there later on and for the very purpose of these transformations. The
                        night however, was far gone into the morning--the morning, black as it was, was nearly ripe for
                        the conception of the day--the inmates of my house were locked in the most rigorous hours of
                        slumber; and I determined, flushed as I was with hope and triumph, to venture in my new shape as
                        far as to my bedroom. I crossed the yard, wherein the constellations looked down upon me, I
                        could have thought, with wonder, the first creature of that sort that their unsleeping vigilance
                        had yet disclosed to them; I stole through the corridors, a stranger in my own house; and coming
                        to my room, I saw for the first time the appearance of Edward Hyde.

                        I must here speak by theory alone, saying not that which I know, but that which I suppose to be
                        most probable. The evil side of my nature, to which I had now transferred the stamping efficacy,
                        was less robust and less developed than the good which I had just deposed. Again, in the course
                        of my life, which had been, after all, nine tenths a life of effort, virtue and control, it had
                        been much less exercised and much less exhausted. And hence, as I think, it came about that
                        Edward Hyde was so much smaller, slighter and younger than Henry Jekyll. Even as good shone upon
                        the countenance of the one, evil was written broadly and plainly on the face of the other. Evil
                        besides (which I must still believe to be the lethal side of man) had left on that body an
                        imprint of deformity and decay. And yet when I looked upon that ugly idol in the glass, I was
                        conscious of no repugnance, rather of a leap of welcome. This, too, was myself. It seemed
                        natural and human. In my eyes it bore a livelier image of the spirit, it seemed more express and
                        single, than the imperfect and divided countenance I had been hitherto accustomed to call mine.
                        And in so far I was doubtless right. I have observed that when I wore the semblance of Edward
                        Hyde, none could come near to me at first without a visible misgiving of the flesh. This, as I
                        take it, was because all human beings, as we meet them, are commingled out of good and evil: and
                        Edward Hyde, alone in the ranks of mankind, was pure evil.

                        I lingered but a moment at the mirror: the second and conclusive experiment had yet to be
                        attempted; it yet remained to be seen if I had lost my identity beyond redemption and must flee
                        before daylight from a house that was no longer mine; and hurrying back to my cabinet, I once
                        more prepared and drank the cup, once more suffered the pangs of dissolution, and came to myself
                        once more with the character, the stature and the face of Henry Jekyll.

                        That night I had come to the fatal cross-roads. Had I approached my discovery in a more noble
                        spirit, had I risked the experiment while under the empire of generous or pious aspirations, all
                        must have been otherwise, and from these agonies of death and birth, I had come forth an angel
                        instead of a fiend. The drug had no discriminating action; it was neither diabolical nor divine;
                        it but shook the doors of the prisonhouse of my disposition; and like the captives of Philippi,
                        that which stood within ran forth. At that time my virtue slumbered; my evil, kept awake by
                        ambition, was alert and swift to seize the occasion; and the thing that was projected was Edward
                        Hyde. Hence, although I had now two characters as well as two appearances, one was wholly evil,
                        and the other was still the old Henry Jekyll, that incongruous compound of whose reformation and
                        improvement I had already learned to despair. The movement was thus wholly toward the worse.
